\textbf{ML experiments} confirm the various assumptions in a ML problem, establish realistic expectations for performance. \textbf{Questions} specific model perform on data from D? a set of models has the best performance on D? models from learning algorithm A perform on D? learning model A produces the best models for domain D?\\

\textbf{Performance measure} accuracy assume the same class distribution of read and test. average recall assume real problem is uniform class distribution.\\

\textbf{Performance estimation}(testing), Holdout Method(leave $\sim30\%$), cross-validation, leave-one-out.\\

\textbf{Cross-validation} reduce the sample variance by $1/\sqrt{k}$. large data sets, fewer folds. For sparse, leave-one-out best. If $var>acceptable\ var$, we need more data. If statisfied, run over the entire data set produce the final model. \\

\textbf{Testing} Applied after the model is finalized.
