similarity is some function of distance. clustering is grouping data without prior information(unlabeled data). \textbf{Why cluster?} \textbullet make apparent the natural groupings/structure in the data (perhaps for further processing)
\textbullet To discover previously unknown relationships \textbullet To provide generic labels for the data
\\
\textbf{Clustering} we organize data into classes such that:
\textbullet The within-class (intra-class) similarity is high(Lower intra-class variance)
\textbullet The between-class (inter-class) similarity is low(Higher inter-class variance)
\textbullet Objects in the same group (a cluster) are more similar to one another than to objects in other groups (clusters)

\textbf{Distance measures} D(x1,x2) is a function D: $X\times X\rightarrow R$ such that for any xyz in X:
1. D(x,x) = 0  2. If x != y then $D(x,y) > 0$ 3. D(x,y) = D(y,x) 4. $D(x,z)\leq D(x,y)+D(y,z)$. \textbf{Common Distance measures} Manhattan, Euclidian, Minkowski($L_p$)
